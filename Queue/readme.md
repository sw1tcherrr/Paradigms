# Queue

Illustration of OOP paradigm



Implements ArrayQueue as module, abstract data type and classic oop class

Methods have pre- and postconditions



Implements ListQueue

No code duplication by using abstract parent class and private `_impl` methods



Effectively implements additional methods:

- `getNth(n)` – create new queue containing every nth element
- `removeNth(n)` – create new queue containing every nth element and remove them from old queue
- `dropNth(n)` – remove every nth element
